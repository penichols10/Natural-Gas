## Introduction
In this repository, a time series analysis is performed on natural gas prices to predict natural gas prices. To do so, an LSTM model is trained.

## Next Steps
The model is currently trained on a dataset from Kaggle which is both very clean and uncited. As such, the logical next step is to scrape or otherwise obtain real data and retrain the model.
